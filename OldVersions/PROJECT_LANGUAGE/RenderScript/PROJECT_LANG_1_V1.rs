// Notes
// I don't know how to make strings in RenderScript, so comments will do for now

// Project language file 1
// For: seanpm2001/Learn-RenderScript
// About:
// I decided to make RenderScript the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-RenderScript) as RenderScript is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the RenderScript programming language. It only makes sense to make RenderScript the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
